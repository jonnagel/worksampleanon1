# Work Sample for Anonymous

A recent work sample I submitted to an unnamed entity. The basic intent of this is to clean and model messy data.

Data for this analysis can be found here https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action

You will note that most of the code is comment out. Simply run all of the commented code once to generate the pickled classifiers, it will take some time. Then you should be able to run the code as it is in the repo.

I'm told this was one of the most accurate and interesting submissions they received.
